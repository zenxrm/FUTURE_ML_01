# Sales & Demand Forecasting for Retail Stores

## Overview
This project focuses on building a Machine Learning based sales forecasting system using historical retail data. The objective is to predict future sales demand and present the results in a business-friendly manner.

Sales forecasting is a critical task for businesses to plan inventory, manage cash flow, optimize staffing, and reduce losses due to overstocking or understocking.

## Dataset
### Store Sales – Time Series Forecasting (Kaggle)
-dataset link: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/store-sales-time-series-forecasting
- The dataset includes:
- Historical sales data
- Store and product family information
- Promotion details
- Oil prices (important for Ecuador’s economy)
- Holidays and special events

---

## Objectives
- Prepare and clean time-based sales data  
- Engineer relevant features such as seasonality and trends  
- Train a Machine Learning model for sales prediction  
- Evaluate model performance using error metrics  
- Visualize forecasts for easy business interpretation  

---

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## Methodology
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
2. Feature engineering (date features, promotions, holidays, oil prices)  
3. Model training using Random Forest Regressor  
4. Model evaluation using Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
5. Visualization of historical sales and future forecasts  

---

## Results
- The model successfully captures overall sales trends and demand patterns.
- Future sales were forecasted for the next 15 days.
- Visualizations clearly show historical trends, prediction accuracy, and future demand.

## Business Impact
This forecasting system can help:
- Retail managers plan inventory efficiently  
- Businesses prepare staffing schedules  
- Reduce revenue loss due to demand uncertainty
